\section{Research Interest}
My primary research goal is to develop reliable and efficient machine learning models/algorithms to address real-world challenges. With this vision, my work focuses on the Generalization of Multimodal Learning and the Alignment of MLLMs. Currently, my research interests include:
\begin{itemize}
      \item \heading{LLM Alignment}{}{\emph{Inference Time Alignment of LLM/MLLMs, Steering FMs towards Human Preference, Ethical Standards}}{}
      \item \heading{Trustworthy AI}{}{\emph{AI Safety, Fairness, Uncertainty, etc.}}{}
      \item \heading{Preference Optimization}{}{\emph{Online Preference Optimization, Self-Improving LLM/MLLMs}}{}
      \item \heading{Multimodal Learning}{}{\emph{Multimodal Fusion, Imbalanced Multimodal Learning, Explainable Machine Learning}}{}
\end{itemize}
